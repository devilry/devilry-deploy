# Build for debugging for the configs
This READNE is for developers of devilry-deploy, not for admins installing
Devilry using devilry-deploy.

## Create cache directories
 
    $ mkdir -p buildoutcache/dlcache buildoutcache/eggs

Install system dependencies

## Build buildout

    $ virtualenv .
    $ bin/easy_install zc.buildout==2.2.1
    $ bin/buildout


The only real reason to do this instead or in addition to using the Vagrant
test setup, is when debugging the generated config files, like the Supervisord
configs. They are generated in ``parts/``:

- ``parts/supervisor/supervisord.conf`` is the supervisord config generated
  from the ``[supervisor]`` section of ``buildout-base.cfg``.
- ``parts/solr/logging.properties`` is the SOLR search server logging config
  generated by the ``[solr]`` section of ``buildout-base.cfg``.
- ``parts/devilry-django/`` is the checkout of the Devilry repo downloaded by
  the ``[download-devilryrepo]`` section of ``buildout-base.cfg``.
